# Work Experience

The `WorkExperience` section describes your professional history.

## Why it's important

For most professionals, this is the core of the resume. It provides evidence of your skills and accomplishments in a professional setting. It allows recruiters to see your career progression and the impact you've made in previous roles.

## Schema

```typescript
interface WorkExperience {
  id: number;
  jobTitle: string;
  company: string;
  location: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  summary: string;
  keywords: string; // Comma-separated list
}
```

## Example

```json

  "type": "work_experience",
  "body": [
